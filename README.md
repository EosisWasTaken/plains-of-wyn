# Plains of Wyn
Plains of Wyn is a text-based RPG made in JS (I'm changing the language from Python to JS) as my first beginner project!
One day I'll make a doc, but for now the project is too small to make docs on something x)
For now, you can check the project's kanban page to see where I'm going!
